Before You Start...
=
**This is an experimental project!!!**  
Its structure is not good and there may be some compatible issues.  
EF is aimed at personal using, so if you are sure about using this framework, you may need to fix some problems by your self.  
EF's structure is quite simple, so you can make some differences or add some new features.  

Enterprise Framework
=
Enterprise Framework is a light-weighted framework for php developers.  
**ATTENTION: ONLY WORKS WITH PHP 5.3 or higher!**

Introductions
=
I have used Codon Framework(by Nabeel Shahzad) and ThinkPHP Framework(by Top Think Incorporated) and I found there are some problems between two frameworks. Codon has less features and it's hard to use. ThinkPHP is really easy to start, but it's not really useful for small projects.  
Enterprise Framework is designed with my & my friends' habits and there is just the alpha version.(It will always be the experimental version.) We all hope it will be better someday.

Other
=
1. This framework is released under Do What The Fuck You Want To Public License.
2. This is just the alpha version so it may has some issues. Don't panic, contribute this project with us.
3. ... to be continued
