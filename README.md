Enterprise Framework
===================
Enterprise Framework is a light-weighted framework for php developers.
*ATTENTION: ONLY WORKS WITH PHP 5.3+*

Introductions
============
I have used Codon Framework(by Nabeel Shahzad) and ThinkPHP Framework(by Top Think Inc,) and I found there are some problems between two frameworks. Codon has less features and it's hard to use. ThinkPHP is really easy to start, but the performance is not really great.
Enterprise Framework is designed with my & my friends' habits and there is just the alpha version. We all hope it will be better someday.

Features
========
1. Works with Object Oriented Programming & MVC structure.
2. Single-character functions.
3. 'epdb' database class.
4. Third party class libraries & user-defined global functions.
5. ... to be continued

1. This framework is released with GNU General Public License version 3.
2. This is just the alpha version so it may has some issues. Don't panic, contribute this project with us.
